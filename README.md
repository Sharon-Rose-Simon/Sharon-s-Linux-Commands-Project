# Linux Commands Project  
This project demonstrates basic Linux terminal usage and scripting.

# What I did: 
- Created a list of commands in a text file (`commands.txt`)
- Used a `while` loop to execute each command and redirect output to `output.txt`
- Included basic Linux commands like: `ls -la`, `pwd`, `whoami`, `cat`, `echo`

# Files:
- `commands.txt`: List of commands to run
- `output.txt`: Output of the commands
- `testfile.txt`: Sample file used to demonstrate `cat`
- `report.md`: Summary of what I did
- `screenshots/`: Terminal output for proof

# Skills Practiced:

- Basic Linux shell commands
- Scripting with `while read`
- File handling with `cat`, `echo`, `>`, and `>>`
