# Linux Commands Project Report

# Purpose

To practice basic Linux commands, scripting with loops, and file handling.

# What I Did

- Wrote a list of common commands in `commands.txt`
- Used a while loop to read and execute each command
- Redirected output to a file called `output.txt`
- Created a test file (`testfile.txt`) and displayed its contents
- Took screenshots to demonstrate successful execution

# Commands Used

- `ls -la`
- `pwd`
- `whoami`
- `echo`
- `cat`

# Risks

None in this context â€” this is a safe terminal scripting exercise on a sandbox environment.

# Conclusion

This helped reinforce the use of basic Linux commands, scripting logic using `while`, and redirecting input/output streams in the terminal.
